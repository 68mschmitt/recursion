Classic Recursive Algorithms

- Binary Search (Recursive)
 - Write a recursive version of binary search for a sorted array.
 - Prototype: int binary_search(int* arr, int left, int right, int target);

- Tower of Hanoi
 - Print the moves required to solve Tower of Hanoi for n disks.
 - Prototype: void hanoi(int n, char from, char to, char aux);

- Generate Permutations
 - Recursively print all permutations of a given string.
